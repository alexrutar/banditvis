        ArmList:
        - [Linear, [1, 1.9]]

    # PlotSave = "temp.pdf"  # should not be an option when running visualize

    # SaveData = True  # not properly implemented (might be automatically saved to timestamped name)

# the Visualize class is to visualize the behaviour of an algorithm in a single cycle
# the bandit and the graph are run concurrently in a single file
